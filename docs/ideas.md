# Improvements

- Github Issues Tab
    - Clear set of labels for issues with description of what they mean and how they should be used.
    - Interact with customers often.
- Clear issue labels
    - Minimize labels to less than twenty too hard to keep track of otherwise.
    - key component names (run, edit, compile, monaco, blocks)
    - question - someone has a question, ideally it should be answered in documentation.
    - suggestion- someone has a suggestion for something
    - wont-fix
    - P0, P1, P2
    - by-design
    - duplicate
    - stale / old - not looking at this because too old and not relevant
- Be clear on intended use and what scenarios are supported
    - Refer to these scenarios when people ask for things outside of those scenarios.
- Clear local development documentation
- Have a set of pre canned responses
- Philosophy of do it well or don't do it.
- What is the difference between closing issues as not planned and closing them? When should you use either option?
- Is it possible to have the monaco shortcuts mirror vs code?
- Have an updates tab that displays a changelog of what has recently changed.
- Explanation of libraries tab
    - Explain that it only loads js, css, and types files as is.
    - We do not do any complex logic like trying to load a npm package. If you want to do that build a full website with a build system.

- copy manifests to standard C:\share for testing on native, and prefix with the add-in name.

- Can I allow custom buttons to active specific snips?

Tests

- What happens with snips with really long names?
- Capture tab key in monaco editor instead of moving around to buttons
